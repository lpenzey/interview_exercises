This is a collection of solutions to coding challenges from projecteuler.com and Cracking the Coding Interview Book. All solutions are tested and were built using TDD. This repo will be periodically updated as more problems are solved. 

##Cracking the Coding Interview
###Chapter 1: Arrays and Strings

####1.1 - Is Unique
Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
cannot use additional data structures? 

####1.2 - Check Permutation
Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the
other

####1.3 - URLify
Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string
has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
length of the string. 

####1.4 - Palindrome Permutation
Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words. 

####1.5 - One Away
There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character,
remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
one edit (or zero edits) away. 

####1.6 - String Compression
Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the
"compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z). 

###Chapter 2: Linked Lists
Implementation of a basic linked list data structure. 

##Project Euler
####1 - Fibonacci Calculator
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not 
exceed four million,find the sum of the even-valued terms.

####2 - Multiples Calculator
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

####3 - Prime Factors
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
